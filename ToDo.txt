Work in progress
================

- [ ] Add export/import to csv format support to frontend

- [ ] Supports keybindings which opens a small pop up menu & 
        allows you to search passwords on the fly and copy 
        to clipboard with autocomplete feature

- [ ] Fix the notes interface so that it prompts
      the user y/n to add notes, and then accept
      an escape sequence such as Esc / Ctrl-C 
      instead of Enter to finish editing. Enter
      should signify newlines only.

- [ ] Fix the record adding section so that they use
      the new dynamic space allocation function for input &
      display text as fixed width columns

- [ ] Config data needs to be built into the database
        [ ] Store cloud credentials for syncing backup
        [ ] Keep entry of last backed up time and date
        [ ] Provides a list of available backups
            for user to select & restore from, will display
            number of entries as well as an option
            to show summary of what is being added to database.
        [ ] Will save user preference of backup type 
            (daily/weekly/monthly)

- [ ] Supports google drive for cloud storage as backup
        [ ] Sync function that uses daily, weekly, monthly
            backup option depending on what is set in config.
            Default is weekly.
        [ ] Finish TODO for cloud sync part in database section

- [ ] Add feature: Recovery questions.
      Prompt y/n, and allow them to enter
      both question and answers aswell as
      multiple recovery questions for the same
      site

- [ ] Support for meta data by tracking which site was 
        copied the most or used as part of show index function.
        [ ] Use this meta data to rank sites based on 
            their usage
        [ ] Show stats in the form of charts / graphs
            on which sites were used the most for a specific
            period such as 3/6 months / year, etc.

- [ ] Keep track of last modified variable for passwords
        & remind user if they exceed the desired length 
        of time (e.g 6 months, 1 year, etc.)


- [ ] Display info page by page similar to less

- [ ] Automatically secure wipe memory segments before exiting

- [ ] Add a logger function so that every action is time stamped
      & can be tracked for source of bugs


Optimization:
=============

- [ ] Time the database load function & see which functions are the
      bottleneck and can be optimized further

- [ ] Remove redundant logic checking from both backend & frontend


Known Bugs: ([x] = Fixed, [ ] = Not yet)
========================================

- [x] Check for duplicates in database
        & prompt user if they want to add that anyway

- [x] Without adding entry to database, it fails to load.
        This is because __encrypt_database() function doesn't
        check whether database is empty

- [x] Fix the exception handling scenarios in frontend 
      listed as TODO in database

- [x] Fixed bug in show index function that had incorrect text
      alignment

- [x] Make sure database for user is stored under ~/.config/pwmgr/data.bin
      instead of current directory otherwise database would be inaccessible
