            confirmation
        [x] Improve password generation menu &

        [x] Fix title bar for show_summary command

- [x] Uses custom database system 

- [x] Encrypts and saves user data 

- [x] Can decrypt & load encrypted data

- [x] Generates secure password

- [x] Can export and import to csv file

- [x] Add option to change encryption password
        as part of cmdline interface in frontend

- [x] Add option to remove password from keyring
        as part of cmdline interface in frontend

- [x] Pass migration script builtin
        (Can migrate passwords from pass)
        [x] Create progress bar
        [x] Modify the script so that file attributes
            such as last modified for individual passwords
            are automatically parsed & added to records
        [x] Fix pass migration script so that 'Generate password *'
            doesn't show up as site name & only that site name

- [x] Urgent fixes that need to be made
        [x] Fix display menu so that records are displayed
            under correct fields

- [x] Supports keybindings which opens a small pop up menu & 
        allows you to search passwords on the fly and copy 
        to clipboard with autocomplete feature

- [x] Add export/import to csv format support to frontend

- [x] Fix edit menu display indentation issues

- [x] Export to csv function should support 2 formats
        [x] Export option allowing all fields
        [x] Export option allowing only 'site,pass,username' fields

- [x] Sort & display function 
        [x] Sort by site name (default)
        [x] Sort by most recently modified to least.
            This can be viewed by '--sort recent' flag

- [x] Another Show index function with binding to dmenu.
      This function can be executed by '--show-dmenu' or '-S'

- [x] Update password generation function so that atleast 
        1 lower case + 1 upper case + 1 symbol + 1 digit is present
        when password with generated with symbols enabled.

- [x] Update format & enable integrity checking of salt + data

- [x] Update format so that there are no limits on size of database

- [x] Don't allow passwords of length less than 8 chars as master password

- [x] Detection of unsupported file format on older versions

- [x] Option to use password generator separately so that a user can
        manually use that to update an existing record with stronger password

Work in progress
================

- [ ] Option --audit 
        1) check database for weak passwords & notify user to
        update them. Weak passwords: e.g: 
        a) less than 6 chars, 
        b) doesn't have atleast 3 char sets (letter (upper/lower), numbers)

        2) Check when password was last updated & remind user if they exceed 
        the desired length of time (e.g > 1 year, etc.)

- [ ] Support for themes. The default one might not render properly on other
        terminals so user should be able should be able to set something else
        
- [x] Import from csv (all fields, not just 'site,pwd,username')
        [ ] Checking for duplicate entries when importing to existing database
        [ ] It has minimal errors checking. It needs to check whether the 
            fields are properly formatted and enclosed in double quotes 

- [ ] Update note section so that it accepts an escape sequence
        instead of enter & can support multi line input for notes, etc.

- [ ] Automatically secure wipe memory segments before exiting

- [ ] Add a logger function so that every action is time stamped
      & can be tracked for source of bugs


Optimization:
=============

- [x] Remove redundant logic checking from both backend & frontend

- [ ] Time the database load function & see which functions are the
      bottleneck and can be optimized further

- [ ] Improve search function by implementing binary search


Known Bugs: ([x] = Fixed, [ ] = Not yet)
========================================

- [x] Check for duplicates in database
        & prompt user if they want to add that anyway

- [x] Without adding entry to database, it fails to load.
        This is because __encrypt_database() function doesn't
        check whether database is empty

- [x] Fix the exception handling scenarios in frontend 
      listed as TODO in database

- [x] Fixed bug in show index function that had incorrect text
      alignment

- [x] Bug that writes database to current directory has been fixed

- [x] Fixed a bug with search bar where it would try to probe for terminal
      size & fail if run as a service. 

- [x] Fixed bug whether last modified variable used a different date & time format
      when being imported from pass password manager.

- [x] Fixed bug that appears when piping output to less or other utilities such as 
        grep as it fails to get terminal size. Now it should work fine.


Things I chose not to update
============================

- Decided not to switch from Fernet to Pycrypto. I was interested in PyCrypto
  GCM mode as it provides authentication of encrypted data. Later I realized 
  that there's no way to differentiate whether the Value error raised 
  when decryption failed was due to key error or because data was tampered with
  (the tag didn't match). I'd probably have to write my own integrity checking 
  function anyway so although GCM is preferred choice over cbc, I'm sticking
  with the default cbc mode in Fernet for now.

- Scrapped the idea of cloud sync. Many people have disagreed with the idea
  of having cloud based syncing option, they simply don't trust anyone
  with their personal data.
