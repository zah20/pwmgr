    PWMGR PRO 3.0 (TBD)
    ===================

    * Backwards compatible with previous version of pwmgr but with more convenience features 

    [ ] Upgraded Secure memory wipe

            [ ] Auditing function

            [ ] Import / Export functions


    [ ] Upgraded Search bar copy & show (-C, -O)

            * Integrates username / email copying function for a site along with

            [ ] Set an additional attribute that tracks which is the primary
                field for a website. Primary field can be set when adding or
                editing a record, it can also be disabled on a case by case
                basis, if you would like to manually type it up.

            [ ] When you select a record it copies username/email for the
                site depending on primary field that was set.
                The software will wait a specific interval that can be
                configured (default 3s), after which it copies the
                password for that record (makes a background sound to
                let you know that username/password has been copied)

            [ ]  Around 6 different sound effect themes 

                [ ] Sound effects indicating username has been selected

                [ ] Sound effects indicating password has been selected

            [ ] Sound effects when buttons get pressed

            [ ] Option to generate hybrid, human memorable passwords based on a combination of dictionary & randomness

                   [ ]  Do not allow weak master password to be set (< 8 chars)

                   [ ] Custom dictionaries can be added to your liking


    [ ] Upgraded UI  

            [ ] PW strength will be shown as a bar with 5 units 
                    (bad, weak, avg, good, excellent)

                [ ] Password generator functions (-a, -g)

                [ ] Show function upgrade (-o, -O)

                [ ] When master password is being chosen for the first time or changed

            [ ]  3D effects on password generator buttons when they are pressed, customized for themes

    [ ] Custom keybinding tool designed for people who are using desktop
        environments & don't know how to bind hotkeys, or do not want to 
        use third party software

        [ ] Video tutorial explaining how to use it. It will have good default
              bindings, also user will be prompted during installation
                phase whether they'd like to activate that.


    [ ]  Faster search

         [ ] Binary search will be used for all manual searches other than search bar


    PWMGR PRO+ 3.0 (TBD)
    ====================

    * This is an upgrade over standard PRO version, has all features of PRO, but with better security 

    [ ] Upgraded Encryption  

            [ ] Stronger key generation function (Replace PBKDF2 with Scrypt)

                [ ]  Set encryption security level when setting up database: Very high, High, Normal, Low

                     This determines how long you need to wait for the key to be
                     generated, varies based on your hardware. You get to choose a level 
                     that you find acceptable.

                     low       = 5-10s
                     normal    = 15-30s
                     high      = 1-5 mins
                     very high = 10+ mins

                     * Once the key is loaded in TPM, no more waiting would be required, 
                        doesn't matter how many times you call the application. 
                         TPM also gets periodically wiped, so if you're using a high setting, 
                           you might want to set a higher keyring wipe interval.
                            There will be good defaults which takes care of this.

            [ ] Custom crypto mix

                * More details will be provided later on how it works, 
                   but let's just say it's intended to offer better security for your encrypted data 
                    over anything else that is currently out there in the market


    [ ] Upgraded Secure Memory Wipe

        * Starting from pwmgr 2.3x, passwords are automatically wiped for various functions,
            but the metadata information (website, username, email, etc.) is still left untouched. 

         With this upgrade we will make sure that there's no trace of data left in memory after program has quit.
            This means that all data types used by our database needs to be ported to use custom C interface

            [ ] Metadata wipe for all known functions

            [ ] Wipe off master & memory encryption keys used by the system 

            [ ] Wipe of master key during change of master password or keyfile


    [ ] Upgraded Audit Function

            [ ] More fine tuned audit metrics

            [ ]  Tests whether any of your passwords are found in leaked password databases
                  online as part of audit function (additional metric)

                  * You can manually add more known pw databases as you like

            [ ]   Prioritize more frequently used sites to be displayed first when using audit function

                  [ ] Create an attribute that tracks how many times a record has been used

                  [ ] Show usage patterns of sites for the week, month or year in the form of graphs and charts


    [ ]  Remove dependency on external utilities such as:

            [ ] Key file generation using dd

            [ ] Replace the following tools with native python functions:
                      echo, grep, cut, awk, xrandr
