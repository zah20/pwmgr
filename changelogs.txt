    * Other than future bug fixes, UI upgrades, etc. I'll not be making any major changes to pwmgr 2.6.x. 

      Currently also working on Cloudchat project, when its complete, I'll start on Pwmgr PRO version. 

      As I've bills to pay, so it would be nice if I can get paid for my work. Therefore, the PRO version will be paid only. 
       There will be two versions: PRO and PRO+. PRO will be affordable, where as PRO+ a bit higher priced.
        PRO will make things more convenient to use, whereas PRO+ will be an upgrade over PRO, with focus on security.
           By default pwmgr offers an acceptable level of security, so for most people PRO version would be good enough, 
             but if security is very important for you, PRO+ would be a better choice.

       Code will be distributed along with documentation just like regular pwmgr so you know what to expect. 
        On top of this, there will be an in depth video series demonstrating key features (live memory forensics), 
         how to use certain functions, different configuration options, etc. 
          You can take a look at the features being offered in 'pwmgr_pro_features.txt'

       Unfortunately, I cannot give an accurate estimate of when it'll be ready, but most likely by end of next year.


    Version 2.6.1 (06/16/2023)
    ==========================

        Major Bug fixes:
        ----------------

            * After the memory wipe upgrade (>= 2.3.x), purpose of some functions changed, 
                   others got renamed to different ones, so that's the cause for all of these issues listed below:

            [x] PW Audit fn was using encrypted password field instead of real password, 
                  so that means whatever audit you did in previous versions (>= 2.3.x) was incorrect, now that has been fixed.

            [x]   Surprisingly show summary (-o) function was leaking password information, that also has been fixed


        Other improvements:
        -------------------

            [x] Audit function upgrade (audit)

                     Now it only displays records that have average, weak or critical security rating. 

                        If you would like to see audit of all records, you can pass 'show-all' as the 2nd parameter. 
                          
                        Also please note that audit function doesn't have memory wipe feature at this time, 
                           therefore use it sparingly, only when you need it.


            [x] Show function upgrade

                   [x] Theme#66

                       [x] Now the PW field only displays color codes based on password complexity, instead of security rating. 
                              Security ratings can change due to password being reused, last modified timestamp, etc therefore we do not
                               want to display inaccurate information 
                            
                       [x] Last modified fields values are now calculated dynamically, therefore more accurate than previous versions

                       [x] Show index function (-o) now supports Theme#66 & color coded audit attributes

                       
                   [x]  Terminal echo has been disabled, therefore, no accidental keypresses will be displayed on screen for show function (-O)

                   [x]   Align text in center (vertically) when using show function (-O)


            [x] Font stuff

                [x] Config restrictions related to font type (for searchbar) have been removed

                [x] '--search-font' function

                    * Even if the right fonts are installed, if it's not specified correctly in config, 
                        it won't get loaded in search bar. Therefore, this function allows you to figure out 
                            what the font name needs to be.


            [x] Edit function upgrade (-e)

                   [x] Indentation issues after a field gets edited, have been fixed


    Version 2.6.0 (06/05/2023)
    ==========================

    [x] 1 new theme (theme#66)

        * With this theme if you use the show function (-O), it'll color code
          the password and last modified field base on
          relevant audit attributes.

          If a record has not been audited, there will not be any colors displayed,
            therefore make sure that you run the audit function first.

    [x] For some reason audit attribute were not getting saved, that has now been fixed

    [x] With introduction of sec memory feature, the last modified attribute wasn't getting
            updated after you used edit function, that has now been fixed

    [x] Removed unnecessary exception handling code for memory wipe


    Version 2.4.1 (06/03/2023)
    ==========================

    [x] Fixed add fn with duplicate entry code fault. I worked on this long time
        ago, but I didn't realize that apt's messed it up down the line.


    Version 2.4.0 (05/29/2023)
    ==========================

     [x] Code audits were made through open source static code analysis software
         such as prospector, pylint, etc. as a result a lot of unused variables, 
         functions, imports, etc. were removed, indentation as well as other exception 
         handling issues were fixed, leading to a much more stable code base

     [x] Edit function upgrade

            [x] Now integrated with secure memory wipe feature
            [x] Colors from theme are now displayed for header fields

     [x] Removed database migration options from 'pass unix pwmgr' as we have import-csv function


    Version 2.3.0 (04/26/2023)
    ==========================
    
    [x] Secure memory wipe upgrade (need to install glibc package, checkout installation section in guide)

         * When copying password to clipboard or displaying a record, that was the only 
            scenario where we decrypted password in memory. It was not possible to 
            overwrite memory section in python as it doesn't allow direct memory access. 

             Now we have designed a custom class which interfaces with c at a lower level allowing us to 
             securely wipe off memory, therefore reducing potential attack surface. This upgrade ensures 
             that no passwords are leaked through memory by any means when the following functions are called:

                  [x] Copying password to clipboard (-c, -C)

                  [x] Displaying passwords for one more records (-o, -O)

    [x] Theme upgrades

          * Now every theme has a bolder color for the show function (-o, -O),
             this improves the overall contrast, therefore increasing readability


    Version 2.1.1 (03/01/2023)
    ==========================

    [x] Copy to clipboard function still had issues with quoted text, it has been fixed. 


    Version 2.1.0 (02/26/2023)
    ==========================

    [x] Upgrade help text

    [x] Upgrade import-csv function with more options

             - Site, PW
             - Site, PW, Username, Email
             - Site, PW, Username, Email, Notes

    [x] Automatic text adjustment due to screen resizing when using:

        [x] Show command '-O'
        [x] Password generator function standalone
        [x] Password generator function in add function

    [x] Show index function should be upgraded so that 
        when displaying headers it matches the theme instead of all yellow :/

        [x] Field header should have foreground color of the theme 

        [x] Remove borders in show index function with thin lines of '-',
             makes it look cleaner

    [x] Fix all known bugs 

        [x] Searching using -O & if chosen value doesn't exist it needs
             to quit with an exit status of 1 (catch ValueError) 

        [x] Show index function needs to be upgraded so that they can

             [x] Display characters 100+
             [x] Have dynamic resizing of multiline text

        [x] Have the ability to use quotations as part of password field
             For this to work copy to clipboard function needs to have 
             proper escape characters
