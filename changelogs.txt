    Version 2.4.1 (06/03/2023)
    ==========================

    [x] Fixed add fn with duplicate entry code fault. I worked on this long time
        ago, but I didn't realize that apt's messed it up down the line.
        This makes me look like a bad coder :/

        With such a big code base one doesn't always have time to test everything.
        I'm tired of these idiots, it's not the first time they've messed with
        my stuff. Like a bunch of crabs they try to bring you down 
        just to show how good they are at hacking.

        Why don't you hack your genes and grant yourself immortality? I'm pretty sure
        such narrow minded crabs dont have that.

        If you don't like my code, don't touch it. If you want to prove
        something to us, give us something we need. All the biggy guys didn't
        give us anything but faulty, backdoored bullshit software as gifts,
        othertimes nothing at all for decades. Who needs people like those?


    Version 2.4.0 (05/29/2023)
    ==========================

     [x] Code audits were made through open source static code analysis software
         such as prospector, pylint, etc. as a result a lot of unused variables, 
         functions, imports, etc. were removed, indentation as well as other exception 
         handling issues were fixed, leading to a much more stable code base

     [x] Edit function upgrade

            [x] Now integrated with secure memory wipe feature
            [x] Colors from theme are now displayed for header fields

     [x] Removed database migration options from 'pass unix pwmgr' as we have import-csv function


    Version 2.3.0 (04/26/2023)
    ==========================
    
    [x] Secure memory wipe upgrade

         * When copying password to clipboard or displaying a record, that was the only 
            scenario where we decrypted password in memory. It was not possible to 
            overwrite memory section in python as it doesn't allow direct memory access. 

             Now we have designed a custom class which interfaces with c at a lower level allowing us to 
             securely wipe off memory, therefore reducing potential attack surface. This upgrade ensures 
             that no passwords are leaked through memory by any means when the following functions are called:

                  [x] Copying password to clipboard (-c, -C)

                  [x] Displaying passwords for one more records (-o, -O)

    [x] Theme upgrades

          * Now every theme has a bolder color for the show function (-o, -O),
             this improves the overall contrast, therefore increasing readability


    Version 2.1.1 (03/01/2023)
    ==========================

    [x] Copy to clipboard function still had issues with quoted text, it has been fixed. 


    Version 2.1.0 (02/26/2023)
    ==========================

    [x] Upgrade help text

    [x] Upgrade import-csv function with more options

             - Site, PW
             - Site, PW, Username, Email
             - Site, PW, Username, Email, Notes

    [x] Automatic text adjustment due to screen resizing when using:

        [x] Show command '-O'
        [x] Password generator function standalone
        [x] Password generator function in add function

    [x] Show index function should be upgraded so that 
        when displaying headers it matches the theme instead of all yellow :/

        [x] Field header should have foreground color of the theme 

        [x] Remove borders in show index function with thin lines of '-',
             makes it look cleaner

    [x] Fix all known bugs 

        [x] Searching using -O & if chosen value doesn't exist it needs
             to quit with an exit status of 1 (catch ValueError) 

        [x] Show index function needs to be upgraded so that they can

             [x] Display characters 100+
             [x] Have dynamic resizing of multiline text

        [x] Have the ability to use quotations as part of password field
             For this to work copy to clipboard function needs to have 
             proper escape characters
