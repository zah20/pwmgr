                          Bug Fixes & Optimization
                          ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    [x] Fixed a critical bug related to libc path detection (for memory wipe functionality),
          which was not working properly under Ubuntu Linux

    [x] Fixed a bug related to duplicate namespace usage when a module is
             imported under a different name while default name is still present
                 (datetime module @ database_pwmgr)

          * This is allowed in Python, but is not a good practice &
                could be prone to future errors

    [x] Help text has been updated, some of the commands have undergone changes. 
           Please check it out for more information.


    [x] load_database() and load_database_key() functions have been merged,
           and all of them including write_encrypted_database() has been
           completely rewritten from scratch reducing code complexity,
           as well as code size by roughly 200-300 lines of code


                               New Features
                               ━━━━━━━━━━━━

    [x] User Interface Upgrades:

         [x] Upgraded the interface so that yes/no styled questions are reduced to a single keystroke

         [x] Pw generation UI has been upgraded with auto resizing when buttons are pressed

         [x] Common functions such as add, edit, reset-pw, etc. interfaces have undergone some minor changes

         [x] Show commands now display pw complexity without having to run audit function

    [x] Security Upgrades:

         [x] Audit metrics 

                  PW complexity has been updated to provide more accurate prediction,
                    one that aligns with real world scenarios

                    *  The default is set to 15+ for excellent and 21+ for superb.
                          It now uses a more fine tuned, non linear grid, which is much more 
                             accurate and penalizes bad passwords more.

                      PW age auditing metrics have been updated so that it has more effect on high ratings 
                           if they have not been changed in a long time

         [x] Keyfile generation algorithm is coded from scratch using native Python instead of relying on dd utility.

         [x] TPM key scrambling has been implemented using a temporary key.

                * We have tpm key expiration, but we don't want anyone to be able to directly grab key out of tpm and use it

         [x] File format has been upgraded. Now it properly handles errors,
	 	      therefore reducing attack surface from local exploits

    [x] Added an automatic installation script for Ubuntu, Arch Linux & Manjaro distributions

          * If you're using any of the supported distributions, just cloning the project &
              running the setup script should be enough. Please note that it has
               not been thoroughly tested yet, so there maybe some bugs. Take a
                 look at the documentation section on how to install manually.

         [x] This setup script has built in hashing mechanism, to determine whether
                 integrity of any of the modules have been compromised

             * From now on, every release will have it's own set of hashes 
                   which you also can manually verify

    ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

        Major Bug fixes:
        ----------------

            * After the memory wipe upgrade (>= 2.3.x), purpose of some functions changed, 
                   others got renamed to different ones, so that's the cause for all of these issues listed below:

            [x] PW Audit fn was using encrypted password field instead of real password, 
                  so that means whatever audit you did in previous versions (>= 2.3.x) was incorrect, now that has been fixed.

            [x]   Surprisingly show summary (-o) function was leaking password information, that also has been fixed


        Other improvements:
        -------------------

            [x] Audit function upgrade (audit)

                     Now it only displays records that have average, weak or critical security rating. 

                        If you would like to see audit of all records, you can pass 'show-all' as the 2nd parameter. 
                          
                        Also please note that audit function doesn't have memory wipe feature at this time, 
                           therefore use it sparingly, only when you need it.


            [x] Show function upgrade

                   [x] Theme#66

                       [x] Now the PW field only displays color codes based on password complexity, instead of security rating. 
                              Security ratings can change due to password being reused, last modified timestamp, etc therefore we do not
                               want to display inaccurate information 
                            
                       [x] Last modified fields values are now calculated dynamically, therefore more accurate than previous versions

                       [x] Show index function (-o) now supports Theme#66 & color coded audit attributes

                       
                   [x]  Terminal echo has been disabled, therefore, no accidental keypresses will be displayed on screen for show function (-O)

                   [x]   Align text in center (vertically) when using show function (-O)


            [x] Font stuff

                [x] Config restrictions related to font type (for searchbar) have been removed

                [x] '--search-font' function

                    * Even if the right fonts are installed, if it's not specified correctly in config, 
                        it won't get loaded in search bar. Therefore, this function allows you to figure out 
                            what the font name needs to be.


            [x] Edit function upgrade (-e)

                   [x] Indentation issues after a field gets edited, have been fixed


    ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
    ┃                      Version 2.6.0 (06/05/2023)                    ┃
    ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

    [x] 1 new theme (theme#66)

        * With this theme if you use the show function (-O), it'll color code
          the password and last modified field base on
          relevant audit attributes.

          If a record has not been audited, there will not be any colors displayed,
            therefore make sure that you run the audit function first.

    [x] For some reason audit attribute were not getting saved, that has now been fixed

    [x] With introduction of sec memory feature, the last modified attribute wasn't getting
            updated after you used edit function, that has now been fixed

    [x] Removed unnecessary exception handling code for memory wipe


    ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
    ┃                      Version 2.4.0 (05/29/2023)                    ┃
    ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

     [x] Code audits were made through open source static code analysis software
         such as prospector, pylint, etc. as a result a lot of unused variables, 
         functions, imports, etc. were removed, indentation as well as other exception 
         handling issues were fixed, leading to a much more stable code base

     [x] Edit function upgrade

            [x] Now integrated with secure memory wipe feature
            [x] Colors from theme are now displayed for header fields

     [x] Removed database migration options from 'pass unix pwmgr' as we have import-csv function


    ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
    ┃                      Version 2.3.0 (04/26/2023)                    ┃
    ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
    
     [x] Secure memory wipe upgrade (need to install glibc package, checkout installation section in guide)

          * When copying password to clipboard or displaying a record, that was the only 
             scenario where we decrypted password in memory. It was not possible to 
             overwrite memory section in python as it doesn't allow direct memory access. 

              Now we have designed a custom class which interfaces with c at a lower level allowing us to 
              securely wipe off memory, therefore reducing potential attack surface. This upgrade ensures 
              that no passwords are leaked through memory by any means when the following functions are called:

                   [x] Copying password to clipboard (-c, -C)

                   [x] Displaying passwords for one more records (-o, -O)

     [x] Theme upgrades

           * Now every theme has a bolder color for the show function (-o, -O),
              this improves the overall contrast, therefore increasing readability


    ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
    ┃                      Version 2.1.1 (03/01/2023)                    ┃
    ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

     [x] Copy to clipboard function still had issues with quoted text, it has been fixed. 

     [x] Upgrade help text

     [x] Upgrade import-csv function with more options

              - Site, PW
              - Site, PW, Username, Email
              - Site, PW, Username, Email, Notes

     [x] Automatic text adjustment due to screen resizing when using:

         [x] Show command '-O'
         [x] Password generator function standalone
         [x] Password generator function in add function

     [x] Show index function should be upgraded so that 
         when displaying headers it matches the theme instead of all yellow :/

         [x] Field header should have foreground color of the theme 

         [x] Remove borders in show index function with thin lines of '-',
              makes it look cleaner

     [x] Fix all known bugs 

         [x] Searching using -O & if chosen value doesn't exist it needs
              to quit with an exit status of 1 (catch ValueError) 

         [x] Show index function needs to be upgraded so that they can

              [x] Display characters 100+
              [x] Have dynamic resizing of multiline text

         [x] Have the ability to use quotations as part of password field
              For this to work copy to clipboard function needs to have 
              proper escape characters
